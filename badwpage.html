<p>Hello, my name is <b>Nichelle Garvey </b>and I am a current North Seattle Student. I live in Seattle 
    but i am originally from Brooklyn, NY. I am in the Associates in application development. 
</p>
<p>I enjoy reading. <i>These words will be italicized.</i>I'm into autobiographies, fiction, non- fiction. <em>These words will also display italized, HOWEVER, it means that the content is "emphasized"</em>I am interested in being a project manager. I'd 
like to stay in the corporation i am currently in and just move up.
</p>
<!-- You really do not want to use a break tag, becuase you are now affecting the look and feel of your
