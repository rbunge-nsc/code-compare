# How to contribute to our repository

Hello and thank you for being willing to contribute to Group 2's repository. This is an open-sourced repository created for purposes of learning how to use Github. Reading and following these guidelines will help make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

We support the GitHub Code of Conduct to keep our community approachable and respectable. Before contributing to our repository, please read and follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo primarily via Pull Requests. A few general guidelines:

- Please ensure that you are indeed a member of Group 2 before making changes.

### Create a new issue
- Please search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Solve an issue
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make changes in the UI
Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.

### Commit your update
Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Requests
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one .

Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Repository team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can [apply suggested changes directly through the UI](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request). You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).

If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
